# CompSpoof V2 Dataset

## 1. Introduction

CompSpoof V2 is a composite spoofing dataset designed for **speech anti-spoofing** research under realistic and challenging acoustic conditions. Unlike conventional spoofing datasets that focus on isolated attack signals, CompSpoof V2 explicitly models the **coupling between speech generation attacks and environmental interference**, reflecting real-world replay, transmission, and deployment scenarios.

Building upon CompSpoof V1, this version introduces a richer combination of attack sources, environmental sounds, and mixing strategies, with a clear separation between *seen* and *unseen* conditions to better evaluate generalization ability.

## 2. Download

The dataset is released in compressed archives, organized by data split.

Typical download and extraction workflow:

* Download the dataset archives from the official repository or hosting platform
* Extract the contents while preserving the directory structure
* Ensure sufficient disk space before extraction due to the large audio volume

Detailed download links and checksums are provided on the dataset hosting page.

## 3. Comparison with CompSpoof V1

Compared with CompSpoof V1, CompSpoof V2 provides the following improvements:

* **More diverse attack sources**: expanded speech generation and codec-based attacks
* **Richer environmental modeling**: increased variety of background noises and acoustic scenes
* **Composite spoofing design**: tighter coupling between spoofed speech and environment signals
* **Clear seen/unseen partitioning**: explicit separation of attack and environment categories for robustness evaluation
* **Refined metadata**: more detailed annotations to support fine-grained analysis

These extensions make CompSpoof V2 more suitable for studying robustness and generalization in modern anti-spoofing systems.

## 4. Audio Examples

Representative audio examples are provided to illustrate different composite spoofing scenarios, including:

* Clean spoofed speech
* Spoofed speech mixed with background noise
* Composite attacks with unseen environments or generation methods

Audio examples can be found in the provided demo directory or on the dataset webpage.

---

## 5. Dataset Structure

The dataset follows a hierarchical directory structure organized by data split:

* `train/`
* `dev/`
* `eval/`

Each split contains:

* An `audio/` directory storing waveform files
* A `metadata/` directory containing CSV annotation files

All audio files are stored in a unified sampling rate and format for consistency.

---

## 6. Dataset Source

CompSpoof V2 is constructed by combining:

* **Speech signals**: bona fide speech and spoofed speech generated by multiple speech generation systems
* **Environmental sounds**: background noise and acoustic environment recordings from diverse sources

All source materials are either publicly available or licensed for research use. The dataset is intended **strictly for non-commercial research purposes**.

---

## 7. Data Splits

The dataset is divided into three standard splits:

* **Training set**: used for model training
* **Development set**: used for validation and hyper-parameter tuning
* **Evaluation set**: used for final performance reporting

To assess generalization, attack types and environmental conditions are further categorized into **seen** and **unseen** subsets across splits.

---

## 8. Metadata

Metadata is provided in CSV format, with one row per audio file. Typical fields include:

* Audio file path
* Label (bona fide / spoof / composite spoof)
* Speech source and generation method
* Environment source and generation method
* Seen / unseen category indicators

The metadata enables flexible filtering and detailed error analysis.
